# Share Your Basic project files
ShareYourBasic is an aid campaign which uses IAMNOTBASIC viral campaign. 
IAMNOTBASIC is an online t-shirt startup which did a viral referral campaign. 
If a person convinces their 50 friends to drop their email on his/her referral link, 
he/she would gain 12 t-shirts. I realized that I could use this campaign for helping disadvantageous children.

We created a viral helping website which has 10 different accounts at the backside and distributed that emails equally. 
We aimed to collect 500 email in order to reach 120 t-shirts. 
We created the whole process(coding and marketing strategies/texts/video) less than 12 hours.
Less than 24 hours, we reached our goal. 
Directly we collected 604 verified email and It led 1.913 verified indirect pyramid emails.
